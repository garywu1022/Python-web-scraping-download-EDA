# Python-web-scraping-download-EDA
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebook files for web scraping, file downloading, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks.

Project Description
The "Python-web-scraping-download-EDA" repository provides code examples and utilities to perform web scraping, file downloading, and exploratory data analysis using Python. The scripts and Jupyter Notebook files cover various aspects of these tasks and are intended to serve as learning resources and references.

The project consists of the following components:

1. Web Scraping: The scrape_download.py script demonstrates how to scrape data from websites using libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests. It includes examples of extracting information from HTML pages and saving the data in a structured format.

2. File Downloading: The scrape_download.py script showcases how to download files from the web programmatically.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The EDA on Movielens.ipynb Jupyter Notebook provides an exploratory data analysis on a given dataset downloaded from the previous step.
